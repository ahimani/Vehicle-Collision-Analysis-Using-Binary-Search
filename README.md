# Vehicle-Collision-Binary-Search

### Program Description

This program prompts the user for an input zipcode, start date and end date and outputs the details of vehicles collisions in the area and dates provided. The program validates the user input and uses a binary tree to the store the data.

If the tree becomes imbalanced the program applies rotation to the tree (AVL tree) to ensure that the tree is balanced and therefore binary sarch is efficient.

The program continues to prompt the user for details until the user hits quit.
